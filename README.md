Descriptive Analysis
Project Tittle: AWS-Based Academic Record Data Cleaning and Profiling at University Canada West (UCW)
Objective: The primary goal of this project is to perform a descriptive analysis of student academic records by utilizing AWS cloud capabilities for data cleansing and profiling. This study aims to gather high-quality data, identify trends in academic performance, identify disparities, and generate insights to help University Canada West (UCW) enhance academic decision-making and institutional reporting.
Background:Today's data-driven academic environment largely relies on timely and accurate data to inform decisions about curriculum development, student achievement, and institutional reporting at universities like University Canada West (UCW). However, inconsistent data, missing values, and duplicate entries in student records could jeopardize the accuracy of this information and lead to subpar academic performance. Given the increasing volume of academic data generated each term—including student enrollments, course registrations, grades, and delivery methods—ensuring data integrity is essential. Manual data cleaning methods are often time-consuming and prone to errors. To overcome this, UCW is investigating cloud-based technologies such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) to automate and speed up the data preparation process. AWS's robust products, like AWS Glue, AWS DataBrew, and Amazon QuickSight, can efficiently handle large-scale data cleansing, profiling, and visualization tasks. This project will use these AWS capabilities to analyze the structure and quality of academic data, identify trends in student records, and offer valuable insights to enhance academic planning and data governance.
Dataset: The dataset, which contains UCW academic records from the prior academic year, has the following significant features: Student ID: Each student is given a unique number. Program: A degree, such as an MBA, BCom, or BA. Term: Academic term (fall 2024, winter 2025, for instance) Course Code: The code of the enrolled course Instructor: Name of the course instructor Grade: The final score for each course Date of Enrollment: Day of registration for the course Delivery Mode: How the course is delivered (e.g., hybrid, online, in-person). Campus: The location of the course's offering (e.g., Vancouver, Online)
Methodology: a) Data Collection and Preparation - Upload the dataset to AWS services such as Amazon S3 for storage and AWS Glue or AWS Data Wrangler for transformation. Use AWS Glue DataBrew or Python (through local environments or AWS SageMaker) to clean the data: Address missing or null information in grades or course codes. Program titles, course codes, and distribution strategies should all be standardized. Fix errant forms (like text fields or date/time fields) and remove duplicate entries. b) Descriptive Statistics - Calculate summary statistics for profiling and quality assurance, Number of documents with incomplete or conflicting data, The most well-liked courses and programs, Grade distribution and average GPA by course, instructor, and program, and Number of students for each term and mode of delivery. c) Student Segmentation - To identify patterns and improve academic profiling, separate student data: Regularly performing students versus those in danger, Program-specific segmentation (MBA, BCom, etc.), Full-time versus part-time students' enrollment, Analyze the possible impacts of issues with data quality on segment performance monitoring. d) Insights and Findings - Enumerate the key findings, including: Common issues with data input (like inconsistent program labeling or missing teacher names), Grade trends for different terms and courses, Grade distributions in classes or teachers that are abnormally high or low, Long enrollment periods and favored distribution channels. e) Recommendations - Give specific steps based on the results: Use validation checks (such as program name dropdowns) to improve data entry processes., To implement automated cleaning procedures, use AWS Glue DataBrew., Regular academic audits should include descriptive analytics., Boost dashboard usage to make academic planning and reporting easier.
Tools and Technologies: AWS Services (Amazon S3, AWS Glue, AWS Glue DataBrew, AWS Lambda), Python (Pandas, AWS Data Wrangler): for data profiling and cleaning
Deliverables: A comprehensive report detailing the results, recommendations, and process for data cleaning and profiling, Visual dashboards that show academic trends and a summary of data quality, A presentation designed for academic administrators to promote improvements in data governance and student performance monitoring.
